### Do's and Don't's when taking care of chewie

# Do's:
### Do give him love
### Do take him out three times a day: 1. in the morning 2. once in the evening (~5-7pm), 3. once before bed
### Do feed him twice a day after the walk: once in the morning and once in the evening using one yellow measuring cup of food per feeding.
### Do use the provided poop bags for collecting his poop
### Do correct him if he's licking the floor or doing anything he's not supposed to.
### Do utilize the play pen if you need to leave to run an errand or go somewhere without him
### Do put a jacket on him if there's rain OR if the weather is chilly

# Don't's:
### Don't give him any human food
Rationale: He's supposed to be on a diet, and this is just to prevent accidental ingestion of food that's not good for him. 

### Don't let him off leash outside your apartment
Rationale: His recall is not good, so if he gets free from you he may not immediately come back to you....depending on where that happens it could be dangerous for him and for you. If he does get loose your best bet is to try and lure him back with a treat. 

### Avoid taking him to a dog park during his stay
Rationale: He will find the biggest dog in the pen and get them to chase him.... if they catch him and the big dog is rough he's gonna get hurt.

### Avoid interaction with small kids
Rationale: He is very enthusiastic but is not gentle with little ones, he may knock them over or bump them in the face. 

### Don't let him eat grass or any mulch/clippings outside
Rationale: He will throw it up if he eats too much, sometimes he's just weird and likes to eat grass...just pull him away when it happens.

# General Notes:
1. His energy will match your input and enthusiasm, if you are down to play he will play....if you want to chill and sit on the couch he'll come sit next to you.
2. Consider using the playpen at night if you find he's exploring too much at night, I suspect he'll get sleepy at the normal times so that won't be an issue, but just in case use the playpen to avoid him getting into anything while you're sleeping. Depending on how the light hits the condo he'll be up when the sun comes up.
3. Depending on the shoes that are laying around he may be interested in chewing flip flops or slippers, we suggest removing those from his reach so they don't get chewed up.
4. We welcome daily updates, we'll be happy to hear from you!

# Vet Info:
- His normal vet is Banfield Pet Hospital of Queen Anne (address: 512 1st Ave N, Seattle, WA 98109 phone: (206) 285-5161), if anything comes up before 7pm you can call them and try and take him there, but otherwise pursue whatever vet is closest to pursue care.
- If anything comes up please feel free to message us. 

# Included Equipment & Consumables
 - 2 dog bowls
   - One for food, one for water. He will finish his 1 scoop of food within a minute of it being distributed, but for water you can fill up the other bowl and leave it somewhere central and keep an eye on it.... depending on the weather he may drink more or less.  
 - 1 box of hydrolized dog food with yellow scoop
   - He eats 1 yellow scoop of food in the morning *after* he is walked, and one in the evening *after* he is walked
   - Strictly feed him only 2 yellow scoops of food total per day.
 - 1 Towel for drying off after rainy walks
 - Few baby towels for wiping down his paws after walks
 - 1 Playpen fence
   - This is useful for situations where you need to go get groceries or when you need to go somewhere he cannot tag along....he won't enjoy it and will probably whine....but eventually he will just try and sleep. You can leave the frilly skirt cupcake looking bed in the crate with him when left alone, but refrain from leaving the other bed because he may destroy it in protest. 
 - 1 Chuck it ball (these are his favorite, and if its rainy weather outside he can burn a lot of energy playing fetch...just make sure you wait 30ish minutes after feeding to begin play)
 - ~4 rolls of poop bags (he won't need this many but just in case)
 - 1 blue leash
 - 1 black leash 
 - 2 harneses (1 red, 1 blue) (feel free to leave it on him or take it off when he's returned inside your apartment if you're nervous about taking it on and off) 
 - 1 bag of deer treats (should be used sparingly.... < 3 a day and only for good behavior not for general feeding)
 - 1 frilly cupcake looking bed (this one can be left in the play pen with him)
 - 1 fuzzy looking bed (this one is for sleeping at night, refrain from leaving in the playpen with him)
 - 1 white blanket with boston print (this can be placed in the play pen when you need to use it, otherwise it can accompany him when sleeping)
 - 1 blue jacket
 - 1 jacket with flannel red inside
 - 1 reflective silver jacket
 - Toothpaste + toothbrush (we try to brush his teeth whenever we can)
 - 1 nail dremmel, we've recently cut his nails but if him walking around gets to be too noisy you can trim his nails

# Commands he's familiar with:
- "Sit"
- "Down"
- "Wait" (if you want him to stay put *indoors* prior to doing something like hiding a ball for him to find or putting down his food dish....be sure to say "Okay" to release him)
- "Inside please" (This can be used to get him to walk himself into the playpen when you need to leave somewhere without him)

# Favorite pastimes:
1. playing fetch
2. eating
3. napping
4. exploring during walks
5. sunbathing via indoor sunbeams
