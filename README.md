### Do's and Don't's when taking care of chewie

# Do's:
### Do give him love
### Do take him out twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening.
### Do feed him twice a day after the walk, one yellow measuring cup of food per feeding.
### Do use the provided poop bags for collecting his poop
### Do correct him if he's licking the floor or doing anything he's not supposed to.
### Do utilize the play pen if you need to leave to run an errand or go somewhere without him

# Don't's:
### Don't give him any human food
Rationale: He's supposed to be on a diet, and this is just to prevent accidental ingestion of food that's not good for him. 

### Don't let him off leash outside your house/apartment
Rationale: His recall is not good, so if he gets free from you he may not immediately come back to you....depending on where that happens it could be dangerous for him and for you. If he does get loose your best bet is to try and lure him back with a treat. 

### Avoid taking him to a dog park during his stay
Rationale: He will find the biggest dog in the pen and get them to chase him.... if they catch him and the big dog is rough he's gonna get hurt.

# General Notes:
1. His energy will match your input and enthusiasm, if you are down to play he will play....if you want to chill and sit on the couch he'll come sit next to you.
2. Consider using the crate at night if you find he's exploring too much at night, I suspect he'll get sleepy at the normal times so that won't be an issue, but just in case use the crate to avoid him getting into anything while you're sleeping. Depending on how the light hits your apartment he'll be up when the sun comes up.
3. We welcome daily updates, we'll be happy to hear from you!

# Vet Info:
- His normal vet is Banfield Pet Hospital of Queen Anne (address: 512 1st Ave N, Seattle, WA 98109 phone: (206) 285-5161), if anything comes up before 7pm you can call them and try and take him there, but otherwise pursue whatever vet is closest to pursue care.
- If anything comes up please feel free to message us. 

# Included Equipment & Consumables
 - 2 dog bowls
   - One for food, one for water. He will finish his 1 scoop of food within a minute of it being distributed, but for water you can fill up the other bowl and leave it somewhere central and keep an eye on it.... depending on the weather he may drink more or less.  
 - 1 bag of hydrolized dog food with yellow scoop
   - He eats 1 yellow scoop of food in the morning *after* he is walked, and one in the evening *after* he is walked
   - The bag of dog food normally lasts 6 weeks, so he should go through two thirds of the bag by the time we return. Strictly feed him 2 yellow scoops of food total per day.
 - 1 Towel for drying off after rainy walks
 - 1 Playpen fence
   - This is useful for situations where you need to go get groceries or when you need to go somewhere he cannot tag along....he won't enjoy it and will probably whine....but eventually he will just try and sleep. Please do not leave his white bed in the crate with him when left alone, because he may destroy it in protest. 
 - 1 Chuck it ball (these are his favorite, and if its rainy weather outside he can burn a lot of energy playing fetch...just make sure you wait 30ish minutes after feeding to begin play)
 - 1 floppy frisbee (similar with the ball)
 - ~6 rolls of poop bags (he won't need this many but just in case)
 - 1 blue leash 
 - 2 harneses (1 red, 1 blue) (feel free to leave it on him or take it off when he's returned inside your apartment if you've  
 - 1 bag of treats (should be used sparingly.... < 3 a day and only for good behavior not for general feeding)
 - 1 white bed (This can be put anywhere for sleep time, or nap time during the day, please do not let him destroy it.... and to reiterate above, please don't leave it in the play pen with him when you're away).
 - 1 green bed (this one is old and can be left in the play pen with him
 - 1 white blanket with boston print (this can be placed in the play pen when you need to use it, otherwise it can accompany him when sleeping)
 - 1 ripped brown blanket (this one is old and can be left in the playpen with him)
 - 1 maroon vest jacket
 - 1 blue jacket
 - 1 dose of trifexis (this is his flea and heartworm medication, he will be due for a dose on July 9th. We'll send a reminder when we get closer to that date)
 - 1 pill splitter (the pill itself should be quartered so just split it twice with that splitter)
 - 1 bottle green tea shampoo (feel free to bathe as required, he's not due for another bath for a few weeks, but depending on activity or if he gets muddy someplace you may want to wash him
 - 1 bottle whitening shampoo (this is just to keep his white parts relatively bright, just use a little bit of this)
 - 1 starwars container containing a toothbrush head, toothpaste
 - Toothpaste + toothbrush (we try to brush his teeth whenever we can)
 - 1 nail dremmel, we've recently cut his nails but if him walking around gets to be too noisy you can trim his nails
 - ~3 tan towels (These are used to wipe him down and one can be put under his bowls to prevent spillage)
 - 1 container of ear wipes (if he starts shaking his head a lot he may have some gunk in his ears just take a wipe and wipe his ears)

# Commands he's familiar with:
- Sit
- Down
- Wait (if you want him to stay put *indoors* prior to doing something like hiding a ball for him to find or putting down his food dish....be sure to say "Okay" to release him)

# Favorite pastimes:
1. playing fetch
2. eating
3. napping
4. exploring during walks
5. sunbathing via indoor sunbeams
