### Do's and Don't's when taking care of chewie

# Do's:
### Do give him love
### Do take him out twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening.
### Do feed him twice a day after the walk, one yellow measuring cup of food per feeding.
### Do put him in his pen at night before you sleep to prevent him getting into mischief in the morning before you wake up
### Do use the provided poop bags for collecting his poop
### Do correct him if he's licking the floor or doing anything he's not supposed to.

# Don't's:
### Don't give him any human food
Rationale: He's supposed to be on a diet, and this is just to prevent accidental ingestion of food that's not good for him. 

### Don't let him off leash outside your house
Rationale: His recall is not good, so if he gets free from you he may not immediately come back to you....depending on where that happens it could be dangerous for him and for you. If he does get loose your best bet is to try and lure him back with a treat. 

### Avoid taking him to a dog park during his stay
Rationale: He will find the biggest dog in the pen and get them to chase him.... if they catch him and the big dog is rough he's gonna get hurt.

# General Notes:
1. His energy will match your input and enthusiasm, if you are down to play he will play....if you want to chill and sit on the couch he'll come sit next to you. 

# Included Equipment & Consumables
 - 2 dog bowls
 - 1 tub of dog food with yellow scoop
   - He eats 1 yellow scoop of food in the morning *after* he is walked, and one in the evening *after* he is walked
   - The tub of food will be filled in case we're delayed at all, but keep in mind he will *not* finish the entire tub before we return from our trip. Strictly feed him 2 yellow scoops of food total per day.  
 - 1 Towel for drying off after rainy walks
 - 1 Crate
   - This is useful for situations where you need to go get groceries or when you need to go somewhere he cannot tag along....he won't enjoy it and will probably whine....but eventually he will just try and sleep. Please do not leave his bed in the crate with him, because he will destroy it in protest. 
 - 1 Chuck it ball (these are his favorite, and if its rainy weather outside he can burn a lot of energy playing fetch...just make sure you wait 30ish minutes after feeding to begin play)
 - N rolls of poop bags
 - 1 blue leash 
 - 2 harneses (1 red, 1 blue) (feel free to leave it on him or take it off when he's returned inside your apartment if you've  
 - 1 plastic box of treats (should be used sparingly.... < 5 a day and only for good behavior not for general feeding)
 - 1 white bed (This can be put anywhere for sleep time, or nap time during the day, please do not let him destroy it.... and to reiterate above, please don't leave it in the crate with him when you're away).
 - 1 white blanket with boston print
 - 1 yellow rain coat

# Commands he's familiar with:
- Sit
- Down
- Wait (if you want him to stay put *indoors* prior to doing something like hiding a ball for him to find or putting down his food dish....be sure to say "Okay" to release him)

# Favorite pastimes:
1. playing fetch
2. eating
3. napping
