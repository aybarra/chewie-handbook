### Do's and Don't's when taking care of chewie

# Do's:
### Do take him out twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening.
### Do feed him twice a day after the walk, one yellow measuring cup of food per feeding.
### Do put him in his crate at night before you sleep to prevent him getting into mischief in the morning before you wake up
### Do use the provided poop bags for collecting his poop
### Do give him love
### Do correct him if he's licking the floor or doing anything he's not supposed to.
### Do keep him locked up when you guys eat, to prevent him from eating crumbs in case anything falls during the meal

# Don't's:
### Don't give him any human food
Rationale: He's supposed to be on a diet, and this is just to prevent accidental ingestion of food that's not good for him. 

### Don't let him off leash outside your apartment
Rationale: His recall is not good, so if he gets free from you he may not immediately come back to you....depending on where that happens it could be dangerous for him and for you.

### Don't take him to a dog park during his stay
Rationale: There's a lot of unpredictability taking dogs to a dog park, just to avoid possible injury best to avoid it.
